# OCR (Optical Character Recognition) System

This project implements an Optical Character Recognition (OCR) system using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with TensorFlow/Keras. The OCR model is trained to recognize alphabets from images. The convolutional architecture is designed to efficiently learn and classify alphabetic characters with high accuracy.

## Introduction

OCR systems have a wide range of applications, including document digitization, text extraction from images, and handwriting recognition. This project focuses specifically on recognizing alphabets, providing a foundation that can be extended to more complex character recognition tasks.

## Key Features

- **CNN Architecture**: Utilizes a Convolutional Neural Network architecture for effective feature extraction and classification of alphabetic characters.
  
- **Training and Validation**: Trains the OCR model using labeled training data and validates its performance using separate validation data.

- **Prediction**: Provides functionality to make predictions on new images, enabling users to input an image containing an alphabet and receive the corresponding predicted character.
