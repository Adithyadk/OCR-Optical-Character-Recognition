# OCR (Optical Character Recognition) System

This project implements an Optical Character Recognition (OCR) system using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with TensorFlow/Keras. The OCR model is trained to recognize alphabets from images. The convolutional architecture is designed to efficiently learn and classify alphabetic characters with high accuracy.

## Introduction

OCR systems have a wide range of applications, including document digitization, text extraction from images, and handwriting recognition. This project focuses specifically on recognizing alphabets, providing a foundation that can be extended to more complex character recognition tasks.

Absolutely! Here's a complete Git README code for your OCR project:

**Alphabetic OCR with TensorFlow**

This project implements an Optical Character Recognition (OCR) model using TensorFlow and Keras that recognizes single alphabets (a-z).

**Requirements:**

* TensorFlow ([https://www.tensorflow.org/](https://www.tensorflow.org/))
* Keras ([https://keras.io/](https://keras.io/))
* NumPy ([https://numpy.org/](https://numpy.org/))

**Data Preparation:**

The project expects two folders named `Train` and `Test` inside the main project directory. These folders should contain images of handwritten alphabets categorized according to their corresponding letters. 

**Model Architecture:**

The model utilizes a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture with convolutional layers for feature extraction and fully-connected layers for classification.

* **Convolutional Layers:** These layers extract features from the input images. They use filters to identify patterns in the data.
* **Max Pooling Layers:** Reduce the dimensionality of the data extracted by convolutional layers.
* **Batch Normalization Layers:** Normalize the data across batches to improve training stability.
* **Flatten Layer:** Reshapes the data from a multi-dimensional tensor to a single-dimensional vector before feeding it into the fully-connected layers.
* **Dense Layers:** Fully-connected layers that perform the final classification of the extracted features.

**Training:**

The script trains the model using the `image_dataset_from_directory` function from TensorFlow to automatically load and preprocess the images from the `Train` and `Test` folders.

**Prediction:**

The script demonstrates how to use the trained model for predicting the alphabet from a single image. It loads the image, preprocesses it, and feeds it to the model for prediction.

**Running the Script:**

1. Ensure you have TensorFlow, Keras, and NumPy installed.
2. Download your training and testing datasets and place them in the `Train` and `Test` folders respectively. 
3. Run the script `ocr.py` (assuming you named it that).

**Saving and Loading the Model:**

The script saves the trained model as `New_Trained_Model`. You can load this model in future predictions using the `load_model` function.

**Further Development:**

This is a basic example of an OCR model for alphabets. Here are some ideas for further development:

* Extend the model to recognize uppercase and lowercase letters.
* Implement techniques for handling noise and distortions in the images.
* Increase the model complexity for improved accuracy. 

I hope this README provides a comprehensive overview of your project!

## Key Features

- **CNN Architecture**: Utilizes a Convolutional Neural Network architecture for effective feature extraction and classification of alphabetic characters.
