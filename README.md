# OCR-Optical-Character-Recognition-
This project implements an Optical Character Recognition (OCR) system using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with TensorFlow/Keras. The OCR model is trained to recognize alphabets from images. The convolutional architecture is designed to efficiently learn and classify alphabetic characters with high accuracy.
